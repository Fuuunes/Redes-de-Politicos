# Redes-de-Politicos ([espa√±ol](/LEEME.md))
============
## The project
**The achievements and failures of a public servant or leader of the civil society
are the sum of their actions and those of their collaborators.**
They choose who do they work with and if they will give them a new position
when they are elected to a new charge.

We frequently watch news about nepotism, corruption and a bad excercise 
of public functions, from both our public servants and the people they
work with. However, at the time of the election the amount of
information we receive makes it easy for us to forget it.

In order to solve this, **we created an app that maps
the relationships between politicians and actors and institutions with whom 
they have mantained a link** (favoritism/influence peddling;
delincuency, misconduct and  irregularities; misuse of public resources).

This way, **the citizen will easily know for who(m) they are
voting** without having to make a long data journey by themselves.
With just a click away, the citizen will be able to know if the people that the
candidate works with or has worked with will contribute to a negative balance
between candidate and collaborators.
